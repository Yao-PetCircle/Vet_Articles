<p>One of the most common reasons for a young puppy or kitten to need to visit the vet (outside of vaccinations) is for runny stools or diarrhoea. There are many potential causes for this, including parasites, bacteria, viruses and stress, however one of the biggest factors is sudden dietary changes. In their first few weeks at home with you, your new addition will be adjusting to a lot of new experiences, people, pets and things, and despite our best efforts this can be a stressful. Avoiding sudden dietary change during this period is at least one factor you can control!</p>
<div class="featureCopy">
<p>While it may be tempting to switch your new puppy or kitten straight on to the top quality food you have ready for them, it's important to transition them gradually over a week or more to help prevent tummy upsets. Find out how to do this in our handy guide, <a href="/discover/how-to-introduce-a-new-food-to-your-pet">How to Introduce a New Food to Your Pet</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When choosing a food for your puppy or kitten, look for complete and balanced formulas designed to be gentle on the stomach and support digestive security. Top quality, scientific puppy and kitten foods utilise beneficial nutritents such as pre biotic fibres to feed the good bacteria in the gut, as well as colostrum to help support immunity.</p>

<p>While all pets can become infested with parasites, due to their smaller size and novel immune system your new puppy or kitten is particularly susceptible and sensitive to fleas and worms. Heavy burdens of worms or fleas can cause life threatening anaemia or gastrointestinal problems in young animals, so prevention from day one is a must!</p>
<div class="featureCopy">
<p>Pups and kittens can pick up worm infestations from day one through their mother's milk, so it is safest to assume that they have parasites until proven otherwise.<br/><br/>Worm your puppy or kitten when you bring them home with an allwormer such as <a href="/drontal">Drontal</a> or <a href="/milbemax">Milbemax</a>, and continue worming every 2 weeks until they are 12 weeks old, then monthly until they are 6 months old. Dogs and cats over 6 months of age should be wormed at least every 3 months.</p>

<h2 class="custom-discover-heading">3. Bad Behaviour</h2>
<img height="350" src="https://www.petcircle.com.au/petcircle-assets/images/blog/new-pet-problems-feature-3.jpg" width="964"/>
<p>Sadly behavioural problems are one of the major causes young adult dogs and cats are surrendered to shelters and pounds. In Australia and globally there has been a dramatic increase in the number of pets adopted in 2020 compared to previous years, likely as people are spending more time at home in lockdown or isolation.</p>
<div class="featureCopy">
<p>The search engine experts at <a href="https://www.semrush.com/company/">SEM Rush</a> tell us that average monthly searches for "dogs for Adoption" rose from 33,100 in Feb to 110,000 in April, dropping to 74,000 in June and then rising back up to 90,500 in July.<br/><br/>Alongside this, searches for "how to rehome a dog" have seen a drastic increase of 100% from April to July, searches for "how to rehome a cat" have also increased.</p>
</div>
<p>The best way to get on top of behavioural problems in pets is to prevent them from the outset. Putting in the hard yards with training and consistency at the start will pay off a million times over when you have a happy, well adusted, well socialised adult dog or cat.</p>
