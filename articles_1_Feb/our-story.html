                    <center>
                        <p>Like many good stories, Pet Circle's began with a man and his dog. One day Mike noticed that
                            his dad had stopped buying their family's very handsome golden retriever - George - his
                            favourite thing: big, 15 kilogram bags of delicious food, after injuring his back!</p>
                        <p>After a bit of thought, Mike realised that his dad wasn't the only person out there who found
                            the process of driving to the pet store, picking up a huge bag of dog food, and hauling it
                            home to be difficult and time-consuming. So, he thought of a way to tackle the problem. And
                            so, Pet Circle was born - with the aim of helping people care for their pets by making
                            purchasing pet products as simple as possible.</p>
