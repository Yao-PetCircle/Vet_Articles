<h1>Best Dog Brushes in Australia</h1>
<div id="date">LAST UPDATED 9 JANUARY 2024</div>
<p><b><em>This article is written by Pet Circle's qualified veterinarian, <a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/discover/vet-profile-gillian-hill"><span id="article-author">Dr Gillian Hill BVSc (Hons)</span></a> and updated by <a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/discover/vet-profile-maree-monaghan"><span id="article-author">Dr Maree Monaghan BVSc(Hons)</span></a>.</em></b></p>
<h3>Why is choosing the right dog brush important?</h3>
<p>Dog coats are exceptionally varied, so it's no wonder that you need a different tool to groom a <a href="”https://www.petcircle.com.au/discover/beagle-breed-guide”">Beagle</a> than you do for a <a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/discover/breed-guide-alaskan-malamute">Malamute</a>. Picking the right brush will help you to defuse tangles easier, and remove dead undercoat hair (if applicable). The wrong brush can cause discomfort, pain, hair breakage and, quite simply, be ineffective.</p>
<div class="featureCopy">Four reasons why it's important to choose the right dog brush are:
     <ol><li><b>Coat Type</b>: Dogs have a huge variety of different types of coat so it is vital to choose a brush that is suitable for your dog's coat.</li>
<li><b>Design</b>: An incorrect style of brush can cause irritation and even pain, making grooming a very unpleasant experience for your dog.
</li>
<li><b>Purpose</b>: A brush will be ineffective if it is not designed for the purpose you require e.g removing dead undercoat requires an undercoat rake
</li>
<li><b>Size</b>:  Using a small brush for a large dog can turn a grooming session into a long and boring ordeal, so make sure the brush is the correct size for your dog.

<p><a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/discover/breed-guide-french-bulldog">Frenchies'</a> short, low maintenance coats are one of the many reasons for their popularity, however, they still benefit from regular grooming to keep their coats clean and shiny.

<h2 class="custom-discover-heading">What to look for in a dog brush</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, choosing the right dog brush is important to match your dog's coat and size, and the purpose for which you're using it. </p>
<p><b>Bristle brushes</b> can be used for most coat types and there are many variations in size, shape, bristle proximity and toughness. Bristle brushes are perfect for breeds with short, smooth coats. Long haired breeds also benefit from the bristle brush but the proximity between bristles should be greater and the bristle length longer. Smooth and silky coats only need a soft to medium bristle brush whereas breeds with coarse, wiry hair will need a brush with sturdier bristles. Bristle brushes often come in combination with pin brushes - bristles on one side and wire pins on the other.</p>
<p>Ideal for medium to long haired dogs, <b>wire pin brushes</b> are great for removing tangles. Wire pin brushes are best for thick, curly or woolly coats and are usually ineffective on short haired breeds. Dogs with delicate hair like Yorkies are best suited to a wire pin style brush.</p>
<p><b>Slicker brushes</b> are used for dogs with long hair, curly hair and double coats. They are great for defusing tangles and matted hair. They can be used on long and curly haired dogs after a wire pin brush to smooth the coat. The pins on slicker brushes are quite sharp, so brushing should be gentle as not to scratch the skin and they should not be used on the face, especially near the eyes.</p>
<p><b>Deshedding brushes</b> are excellent for reducing bulk hair without comprimising on length. They work by using a bristle-blade combination that selectively de-sheds the undercoat and loose hair without cutting or damaging the top coat on double-coated breeds. These are excellent for double coated breeds who shed a lot of fur.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/dog/grooming/rakes">Undercoat rakes</a></b> are designed for double coated breeds and are wonderful for shedding dogs. The rake catches the dead undercoat hairs to reduce shedding. When choosing an undercoat rake, try to match the length of the rake pins to your dog's hair length.</p>
<p>Rubber or 'curry' brushes are the ultimate beginner's tools. Virtually all dogs love being brushed by the soft rubber or silicon brushes and it is great as an introductory brush to get them used to grooming. The rubber pegs stimulate the capillaries promoting blood flow for a healthier skin and coat. Ideally this brush works best on smooth, short haired dogs but it can be helpful in loosening up the undercoat fur for easier brushing. It's best to do this outside or in the bath when wet as it can end up being a little messy.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.petcircle.com.au/dog/grooming/combs">Dog combs</a></b> are a useful tool to have in your grooming kit. Being smaller, combs allow you greater feel and control for tidying up around the eyes, ears and snout.
