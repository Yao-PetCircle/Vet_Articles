<p><b><a href="/product/feliway-diffuser">FELIWAY</a></b> is a synthetic version of the feline faical pheromone naturally left by cats when they rub against objects in their environment. This pheromone is usually released by your cat when they feel happy or content and is also used to mark territory. Feliway helps to reduce signs of stress such as urine spraying, scratching or hiding.</p>
<p><b><a href="/product/feliway-friends-diffuser-with-refill">FELIWAY FRIENDS</a></b> is a synthetic version of the cat appeasing pheromone (CAP) released by mother cats after birth to help their kittens feel safe and secure. These "harmony" messages help restore harmony between cats living together. Feliway Friends helps to reduce unwanted tension and conflicts, and promote harmony between cats living in multi-cat households.</p>

<div class="featureCopy"><h4>The first thing to consider is whether <a href="/product/feliway">Feliway</a> or <a href="/product/feliway-friends-diffuser-with-refill">Feliway Friends</a> is best for your cat's situation:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>FELIWAY</b> is the best option if your kitty is showing signs of stress such as urine spraying, scratching or hiding. Feliway is also useful in situations such as travelling, visiting the vet or cattery, moving house or decorating, visitors or new household members. Feliway is available in a <a href="/product/feliway-spray">spray</a> or <a href="/product/feliway-diffuser">diffuser</a>.</li>
<li><b>FELIWAY FRIENDS</b> is the best option if you are introducing a new cat to your existing cat, or if the cats in your multi-cat household are not getting along (eg hissing, fighting). Feliway Friends is available only as a <a href="/product/feliway-friends-diffuser">diffuser</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<br/>
<div class="featureCopy"><h4>Can I use both Feliway and Feliway Friends Together?</h4><br/><p>Yes! If you have multiple kitties in conflict that are also displaying stressful behaviours (which is not an uncommon!), then you can absolutely use Feliway and Feliway Friends at the same time.</p></div></div>

<h3>Feliway &amp; Feliway Friends Diffuser</h3>
<p><a href="/product/feliway-diffuser">Feliway</a> and <a href="/product/feliway-friends-diffuser-with-refill">Feliway Friends</a> are both available in diffusers, which operate in the same way. These diffusers are designed to be plugged into an electrical socket and left on continuously 24/7, covering a space of up to 70m<sup>2</sup>. Avoid placing diffusers behind furniture, doors or curtains or underneath shelves as this can make them less effective. Each <a href="/product/feliway-refill">diffuser refill</a> will last for 30 days, depending on surrounding conditions.</p>
<p>Most cat owners see an improvement in their cats within 7 days. However as every cat is different, and their stress levels and triggers vary widely, it can take up to a month to see results.</p>
<h3>Feliway Spray</h3>
<p>The <a href="/product/feliway-spray">Feliway Spray</a> is useful for preventing scratching and spraying as well as making trips in the car and carrier less stressful. It can also be used generally around the home by spraying on prominent areas like window sills, cat flaps and doorways. For spraying or scratching, spray the area that has been marked after it has been thoroughly cleaned. To alleviate travel stress, simply spray inside the carrier or car.</p>
<p>Feliway Spray works in the environment immediately, however it is important to leave at least 15 minutes to allow the alcohol in the spray to evaporate before introducing your cat to the environment. If repeat applications are required, such as during long car journeys, the area can be sprayed every 4-5 hours. Remember to never spray Feliway directly on your cat.</p></div>
